elm-obj-loader
==============

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/declension/elm-obj-loader.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/declension/elm-obj-loader)

This is an Elm library for importing simple [Wavefront `.obj`][objSpecs] files into your WebGL application.

It is currently Elm 0.19, though [the previous incarnation](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/Zinggi/elm-obj-loader/) works for 0.18.


Examples
--------
 * [Model viewer][modelViewer]
 * [Suzanne from Blender][suzanne]

See the [demo source](/examples).


Usage
-----
* Export / convert your model from Blender or other 3D content creation tool as an `.obj` file.
* The default export options from Blender work fine.
* Make sure you keep _Write Normals_ selected.


Limitations
-----------
 
Completely supported face types are those with vertex position, normals and optionally vertex texture coordinates. (`v`, `vn`, `vt`)
Only a small subset of the specification is supported though - specifically:

* Your model needs vertex normals (`vn`).
* Smooth groups are ignored (`s n`).  
* Only tris and quads are supported. (Tris might load slightly faster)    
* No free-form curves / surfaces.    
* No material library ([mtllib](http://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/data/mtl/mtl.html)) support.   
* No negative indexing.
