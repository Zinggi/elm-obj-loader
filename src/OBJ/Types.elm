{-| A .obj file is optionally divided into different groups/objects.
Each group/object is optionally made up of different meshes, each with it's own material.

So the keys of this dictionary are:

    Dict GroupNameOrObjectName (Dict MaterialName Mesh)

If no name is specified in the input file, "__default__" will be used instead.

type alias ObjFile =

{-| A `Mesh` loaded by the obj loader is a record with a list of vertices and a list of indices.
Depending on the mesh type and the loading options you get a different kind of mesh.
They differ on what information a vertex contains.

These meshes are meant to be used with `WebGL.indexedTriangles mesh.vertices mesh.indices`.

{-| A 3D position with a normal and a 2D texture position.
-}
type alias VertexWithTexture =
    { position : Vec3, texCoord : Vec2, normal : Vec3 }


{-| The `tangent` is a vector pointing tangential to the object surface, in the direction of the `u` texture coordinate.
This is needed for doing tangent space normal mapping.
The 4th component is either 1 or -1 and has to be used to get the bitangent in the glsl shader,
e.g: `vec3 bitangent = cross(normal, tangent.xyz) * tangent.w`
